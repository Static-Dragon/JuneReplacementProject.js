# The June Replacement Project
A mod for the Unofficial Homestuck Collection

### What it does
For every pesterlog/dialog that June is referenced, her deadname won't be used  


### How to install  
Download the mod by either [downloading it directly](https://github.com/Static-Dragon/JuneReplacementProject.js/blob/main/JuneReplacementProject.js) OR clicking the green Code button and downloading as a zip, then extracting it.  
When it's done downloading, open the Unofficial Homestuck Collection, head to the settings, then scroll down to **Mod Settings** and click the link "mods directory".  
Now, just move `JuneReplacementProject.js` into the mods folder it just opened.  
  
NOTE: You must have the v2 or higher of the Unofficial Homestuck Collection, as the older one does not support mods.
